Difference between Docker Image and Container:

Docker Image: A read-only blueprint (template) with everything your app needsâ€”code, libraries, dependencies, OS files.

Container: A running instance of an image. Think of it as a live app launched from that blueprint.
Analogy: Image = recipe, Container = cooked dish from that recipe.
